# Neurals-Nets-without-Tensorflow
Following tutorial of iamtrask https://iamtrask.github.io/2015/11/15/anyone-can-code-lstm/

I added an extra layer of neurons and the recurrent synapse. I got it to work for multiplication instead of addition.
I am going to switch it from a Recurrent Neural Network to one where it heas an input neuron per 
digit. I don't know if this will work any better, but in my head it seems like it might.

I want to then try and get it to find prime factors of numbers.
