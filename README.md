# Neurals-Nets-without-Tensorflow
Following tutorial of iamtrask https://iamtrask.github.io/2015/11/15/anyone-can-code-lstm/

For the RNN I added an extra layer of neurons and 2nd batch of recurrent synapses. I got it to work for multiplication instead of addition.

The second file is a Neural Network where it has an input neuron per digit. I don't know if this will work any better.

I want to then try and get it to find prime factors of numbers.
